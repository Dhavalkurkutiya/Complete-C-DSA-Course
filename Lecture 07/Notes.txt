Bitwise operators

Bitwise operators are used to perform bit-level operations on integers. They treat the operands as a sequence of 32 bits (zeroes and ones), rather than as decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers. For example, the decimal number nine has a binary representation of 1001. Bitwise operators perform their operations on such binary representations, but they return standard JavaScript numerical values.

The bitwise operators are listed below:

Bitwise AND (&)
Bitwise OR (|)
Bitwise XOR (^)

Bitwise << (left shift)
Bitwise >> (right shift)
